Finally! My second soundbank for Zebra2 is complete!
Now it sounds really professionally and fat! Rich, deep stereo sounds will simply lift you up to the
clouds, especially if you are Trance or Progressive House lover!

This demo, which is available for downloading and listening contains only a small part of the
sounds. Totally 145 presets arranged in groups (BASS, LEAD, PAD etc.), logically named and
even numbered for easy perception and quick remember (for example, "BASS. 08 - Grim").

Almost every preset can change its sounding by the Modulation Wheel controller, I did not set XY
pads, because did not ever use it, but tuned parameters directly in the instrument. I think it is more
interesting and it gives more accurate results for a new sound! So I recommend it to you.

Mainly sounds playback is standard, but I will give you one advice - while listening to the "POLY"
better set the Modulation Wheel controller to the Max position (ie, its parameter must be equal to
128), because in this position sounds will be considered "open". "Poly" group is intended for Hook
or Lead parties in Trance and Progressive House, similar to the style of Deadmau5, Adam K & Soha
or Leventina (also known under the pseudonyms - Dinka, Edx, Chris Reece, etc.), that is why in
such position of Modulation Wheel controller, "POLY" presets will sound "complete" and "fat".

By the way some of the sounds were created with the help of Zebra 2.5. Unfortunately I could not
check their compatibility with previous versions, so you are strongly recommended to upgrade your
Zebra to version 2.5!
