--A shameless commentary on Vanilla percussion patches for Zebra--

Q: What is it?
A: A careful reconstruction of percussion sounds in Zebra from various sources.  Mostly
from an organized process of sonic and graphical matching of electric and acoustic
samples.  Also a few component-modeling experiments gone right, and a few purely
invented patches.

So, a full set of simple, clean, acoustically 'correct' sounds for percussion tracks.
This doesn't mean boring, thin, untweakable, or lacking in detail!  If I didn't find
this useful for my own purposes, I wouldn't have bothered, and I do hope it's useful
for you.

Q: Why bother with patches versus samples?
A: Pro / Con -

Pro: a patch is essentially a component-based model of a sound, and working with those
components means a different and in a lot of ways more direct control of the sound.

Con: It will never sound 'real' enough to satisfy all.  This is a lot less true for
Zebra patches emulating electronic instruments, and I think some of the acoustic-based
patches here are surprisingly accurate.

In the end, I do believe patches can be very _convincing_, and more useful in a lot of
circumstances regardless of some notion of accuracy.

Q: How does this compare to dedicated percussion synths?
A (part 1): With Zebra's semi-modular patching, in a way the architecture of the synth
can be rebuilt from patch to patch.  This equates to a tremendously large set of tools,
more than would generally be found in percussion synths.  A drawback to this is that
the more modular controls aren't always straightforward to tweak - the knobs are less
specific, and there's more of them.  However, XY mapping can solve for this.  The XY
controls on these patches strives to be a clean, intuitive, simple, effective interface
to something that's more like a classic drum machine or percussion-centric VSTi.

A (part 2): There's always the option of going further than what the XY controls allow.
The sounds and XY controls are by design fairly simple and not extreme, but in the
environment of Zebra anything is possible.  A subtle tweak outside the XY controls might
get a sound to sit perfectly in a mix, or some heavier modification might lead to just
about anything.  These patches could be as useful for mangling as unmangled purposes.

A (part 3): An obvious fact is a lot of drum machines have integrated sequencers.  With
this set some effort is required to set up a DAW to handle sequencing and managing an
instance of Zebra for each sound in a kit the way a drum machine VSTi might do with one
instance.  It may be worth creating some kind of template in order to speed this up.

I'm pretty much always in Ableton Live, where populating a drum rack with several
instances of Zebra is pretty straightforward.  I don't really know enough about any
other major DAW to offer any hints here.  If you have any observations or hints about
this - a goal of this set is something that's as natural and productive as possible, the
way a good beatbox is (or better ;) ), and the sequencing and management could be a
hurdle to that - I'd love to hear them.  I may add some Ableton-specific resources to
the .zip file in the future, and if anyone wants to share a good template project or
object for a DAW...

Some usage tips:

* Zebra's EQ module is very quick to work with, and I think should always be considered
  'tweakable' for these patches - it can really enhance a patch, especially as it sits
  in a mix.  (If you haven't noticed, as I didn't for quite a while, right-clicking a
  puck can adjust Q factor; right-clicking elsewhere brings up a handy copy/paste/reset
  dialog).

* Patches with (parenthesized) names relate to the same machine or a combination of
  similar machines.  Building a kit with all patches named e.g. (Octopus) should yield
  some familiar sounds :)

* The XY controls can make it very easy to create versions of the same kit element with
  different articulation.  Duplicating an instance of Zebra with a snare patch, leaving
  one instance as-is and configuring the other to be a background 'ghost' hit can be as
  easy as cut and paste and a few very quick tweaks.

* As with samples, layering patches - for example a kick and a very short, clicky hat,
  or a snare and some airy clap or noise - is a powerful way to breed new sounds.
  Again duplicating an instance of Zebra can be a quick, easy way of doing this.

* Patches here are pretty dry, not a lot of creative FX use - that's not because effects
  don't enhance the sound, just that I think it makes more sense to stay 'dry' as a
  starting point.

* A filter on SR Decimate can be pretty nice for some sampler vibe.
