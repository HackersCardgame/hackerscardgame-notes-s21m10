This works best from C4 to C5. I have found using two EQ's in the global effects is
a really great way of shaping sounds. When I used it in the mp3, I thinned &
brightened the crash cymbals a bit from the patch here.  It might be a good starting
point for someone else to perfect.
I've been playing synths since the mid 70's...I think Zebra is about the most amazing
synth I've used, hardware or software.
