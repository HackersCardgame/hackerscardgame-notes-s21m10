Thanks for your interest in uk-music sounds for Zebra.
Just add the folder "ukm2" to your Zebra presets.

The sounds were made using a 88 keys keyboard with weighted action. For smaller keyboards it 
may be necessary to transpose from the "Global/FX" section of Zebra. Since I tried to make all 
sounds playable across the whole keyboard range (except those that have a restricted tonal range)
it may be possible that keyboard and velocity scaling have to be fine adjusted too.

Most of the sounds react different when played soft or hard (velocity). According to your playing 
style and the velocity mapping of your keyboard some fine tuning of the above mentioned scaling 
parameters can be necessary too.

Please, make sure that the "Bypass FX" parameter in the "Global/FX" section of Zebra is switched 
"OFF". It seems that this parameter isn't saved with the preset and you'd hear the sound without 
effects otherwise.
Don't forget to try out controllers like modwheel (MW), aftertouch (AT) etc.. In most cases there is a hint in the "Info" of the preset about what is used there.

Have fun;
